<H1><A NAME="SEC1" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC1">Command Line Editing</A></H1>

<P>
This text describes GNU's command line editing interface.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC2">Introduction to Line Editing</A></H2>

<P>
The following paragraphs describe the notation we use to represent
keystrokes.

</P>
<P>
The text <KBD>C-k</KBD> is read as `Control-K' and describes the character
produced when the Control key is depressed and the <KBD>k</KBD> key is struck.

</P>
<P>
The text <KBD>M-k</KBD> is read as `Meta-K' and describes the character
produced when the meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the <KBD>k</KBD>
key is struck.  If you do not have a meta key, the identical keystroke
can be generated by typing <KBD>ESC</KBD> <I>first</I>, and then typing <KBD>k</KBD>.
Either process is known as <STRONG>metafying</STRONG> the <KBD>k</KBD> key.

</P>
<P>
The text <KBD>M-C-k</KBD> is read as `Meta-Control-k' and describes the
character produced by <STRONG>metafying</STRONG> <KBD>C-k</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
In addition, several keys have their own names.  Specifically,
<KBD>DEL</KBD>, <KBD>ESC</KBD>, <KBD>LFD</KBD>, <KBD>SPC</KBD>, <KBD>RET</KBD>, and <KBD>TAB</KBD> all
stand for themselves when seen in this text, or in an init file
(see section <A HREF="rluserman.html#SEC8">Readline Init File</A>, for more info).

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC3">Readline Interaction</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>

</P>
<P>
Often during an interactive session you type in a long line of text,
only to notice that the first word on the line is misspelled.  The
Readline library gives you a set of commands for manipulating the text
as you type it in, allowing you to just fix your typo, and not forcing
you to retype the majority of the line.  Using these editing commands,
you move the cursor to the place that needs correction, and delete or
insert the text of the corrections.  Then, when you are satisfied with
the line, you simply press <KBD>RET</KBD>.  You do not have to be at the
end of the line to press <KBD>RET</KBD>; the entire line is accepted
regardless of the location of the cursor within the line.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC4">Readline Bare Essentials</A></H3>

<P>
In order to enter characters into the line, simply type them.  The typed
character appears where the cursor was, and then the cursor moves one
space to the right.  If you mistype a character, you can use <KBD>DEL</KBD> to
back up, and delete the mistyped character.

</P>
<P>
Sometimes you may miss typing a character that you wanted to type, and
not notice your error until you have typed several other characters.  In
that case, you can type <KBD>C-b</KBD> to move the cursor to the left, and then
correct your mistake.  Aftwerwards, you can move the cursor to the right
with <KBD>C-f</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
When you add text in the middle of a line, you will notice that characters
to the right of the cursor get `pushed over' to make room for the text
that you have inserted.  Likewise, when you delete text behind the cursor,
characters to the right of the cursor get `pulled back' to fill in the
blank space created by the removal of the text.  A list of the basic bare
essentials for editing the text of an input line follows.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-b</KBD>
<DD>
Move back one character.
<DT><KBD>C-f</KBD>
<DD>
Move forward one character.
<DT><KBD>DEL</KBD>
<DD>
Delete the character to the left of the cursor.
<DT><KBD>C-d</KBD>
<DD>
Delete the character underneath the cursor.
<DT>Printing characters
<DD>
Insert itself into the line at the cursor.
<DT><KBD>C-_</KBD>
<DD>
Undo the last thing that you did.  You can undo all the way back to an
empty line.
</DL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC5">Readline Movement Commands</A></H3>

<P>
The above table describes the most basic possible keystrokes that you need
in order to do editing of the input line.  For your convenience, many
other commands have been added in addition to <KBD>C-b</KBD>, <KBD>C-f</KBD>,
<KBD>C-d</KBD>, and <KBD>DEL</KBD>.  Here are some commands for moving more rapidly
about the line.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-a</KBD>
<DD>
Move to the start of the line.
<DT><KBD>C-e</KBD>
<DD>
Move to the end of the line.
<DT><KBD>M-f</KBD>
<DD>
Move forward a word.
<DT><KBD>M-b</KBD>
<DD>
Move backward a word.
<DT><KBD>C-l</KBD>
<DD>
Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top.
</DL>

<P>
Notice how <KBD>C-f</KBD> moves forward a character, while <KBD>M-f</KBD> moves
forward a word.  It is a loose convention that control keystrokes
operate on characters while meta keystrokes operate on words.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC6">Readline Killing Commands</A></H3>

<P>
<STRONG>Killing</STRONG> text means to delete the text from the line, but to save
it away for later use, usually by <STRONG>yanking</STRONG> it back into the line.
If the description for a command says that it `kills' text, then you can
be sure that you can get the text back in a different (or the same)
place later.

</P>
<P>
Here is the list of commands for killing text.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-k</KBD>
<DD>
Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.

<DT><KBD>M-d</KBD>
<DD>
Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or if between
words, to the end of the next word.

<DT><KBD>M-DEL</KBD>
<DD>
Kill from the cursor to the start of the previous word, or if between
words, to the start of the previous word. 

<DT><KBD>C-w</KBD>
<DD>
Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace.  This is different than
<KBD>M-DEL</KBD> because the word boundaries differ.

</DL>

<P>
And, here is how to <STRONG>yank</STRONG> the text back into the line.  

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><KBD>C-y</KBD>
<DD>
Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the cursor.

<DT><KBD>M-y</KBD>
<DD>
Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  You can only do this if
the prior command is <KBD>C-y</KBD> or <KBD>M-y</KBD>.
</DL>

<P>
When you use a kill command, the text is saved in a <STRONG>kill-ring</STRONG>.
Any number of consecutive kills save all of the killed text together, so
that when you yank it back, you get it in one clean sweep.  The kill
ring is not line specific; the text that you killed on a previously
typed line is available to be yanked back later, when you are typing
another line.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC7">Readline Arguments</A></H3>

<P>
You can pass numeric arguments to Readline commands.  Sometimes the
argument acts as a repeat count, other times it is the <I>sign</I> of the
argument that is significant.  If you pass a negative argument to a
command which normally acts in a forward direction, that command will
act in a backward direction.  For example, to kill text back to the
start of the line, you might type <KBD>M--</KBD> <KBD>C-k</KBD>.

</P>
<P>
The general way to pass numeric arguments to a command is to type meta
digits before the command.  If the first `digit' you type is a minus
sign (<KBD>-</KBD>), then the sign of the argument will be negative.  Once
you have typed one meta digit to get the argument started, you can type
the remainder of the digits, and then the command.  For example, to give
the <KBD>C-d</KBD> command an argument of 10, you could type <KBD>M-1 0 C-d</KBD>.

</P>



<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC8">Readline Init File</A></H2>

<P>
Although the Readline library comes with a set of GNU Emacs-like
keybindings, it is possible that you would like to use a different set
of keybindings.  You can customize programs that use Readline by putting
commands in an <STRONG>init</STRONG> file in your home directory.  The name of this
file is <TT>`~/.inputrc'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
When a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the
<TT>`~/.inputrc'</TT> file is read, and the keybindings are set.

</P>
<P>
In addition, the <KBD>C-x C-r</KBD> command re-reads this init file, thus
incorporating any changes that you might have made to it.

</P>



<H3><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="rluserman.html#TOC9">Readline Init Syntax</A></H3>

<P>
There are only four constructs allowed in the <TT>`~/.inputrc'</TT>
file:

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT>Variable Settings
<DD>
You can change the state of a few variables in Readline.  You do this by
using the <CODE>set</CODE> command within the init file.  Here is how you
would specify that you wish to use <CODE>vi</CODE> line editing commands:


<PRE>
set editing-mode vi
</PRE>

Right now, there are only a few variables which can be set; so few in
fact, that we just iterate them here:

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>editing-mode</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
The <CODE>editing-mode</CODE> variable controls which editing mode you are
using.  By default, GNU Readline starts up in Emacs editing mode, where
the keystrokes are most similar to Emacs.  This variable can either be
set to <CODE>emacs</CODE> or <CODE>vi</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>horizontal-scroll-mode</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX3"></A>
This variable can either be set to <CODE>On</CODE> or <CODE>Off</CODE>.  Setting it
to <CODE>On</CODE> means that the text of the lines that you edit will scroll
horizontally on a single screen line when they are larger than the width
of the screen, instead of wrapping onto a new screen line.  By default,
this variable is set to <CODE>Off</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>mark-modified-lines</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
This variable when set to <CODE>On</CODE>, says to display an asterisk
(<SAMP>`*'</SAMP>) at the starts of history lines which have been modified.
This variable is off by default.

<DT><CODE>prefer-visible-bell</CODE>
<DD>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>
If this variable is set to <CODE>On</CODE> it means to use a visible bell if
one is available, rather than simply ringing the terminal bell.  By
default, the value is <CODE>Off</CODE>.
</DL>

<DT>Key Bindings
<DD>
The syntax for controlling keybindings in the <TT>`~/.inputrc'</TT> file is
simple.  First you have to know the <I>name</I> of the command that you
want to change.  The following pages contain tables of the command name,
the default keybinding, and a short description of what the command
does.

Once you know the name of the command, simply place the name of the key
you wish to bind the command to, a colon, and then the name of the
command on a line in the <TT>`~/.inputrc'</TT> file.  The name of the key
can be expressed in different ways, depending on which is most
comfortable for you.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><VAR>keyname</VAR>: <VAR>function-name</VAR> or <VAR>macro</VAR>
<DD>
<VAR>keyname</VAR> is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For example:

<PRE>
Control-u: universal-argument
Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
Control-o: "&#62;&#38;output"
</PRE>

In the above example, <KBD>C-u</KBD> is bound to the function
<CODE>universal-argument</CODE>, and <KBD>C-o</KBD> is bound to run the macro
expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text
<SAMP>`&#62;&#38;output'</SAMP> into the line).

<DT>"<VAR>keyseq</VAR>": <VAR>function-name</VAR> or <VAR>macro</VAR>
<DD>
<VAR>keyseq</VAR> differs from <VAR>keyname</VAR> above in that strings denoting
an entire key sequence can be specified.  Simply place the key sequence
in double quotes.  GNU Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the
following example:


<PRE>
"\C-u": universal-argument
"\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
"\e[11~": "Function Key 1"
</PRE>

In the above example, <KBD>C-u</KBD> is bound to the function
<CODE>universal-argument</CODE> (just as it was in the first example),
<KBD>C-x C-r</KBD> is bound to the function <CODE>re-read-init-file</CODE>, and
<KBD>ESC [ 1 1 ~</KBD> is bound to insert the text <SAMP>`Function Key 1'</SAMP>.
