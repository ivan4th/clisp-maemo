This is GNU CLISP, an ANSI Common Lisp implementation.


What is LISP?
-------------

LISP is a general purpose programming language.
It was invented by J. McCarthy in 1959.
There have been many dialects of it, but nowadays LISP has been standardized
and wide-spread due to the industrial standard ANSI COMMON LISP. There are
applications in the domains of symbolic knowledge processing (AI), numerical
mathematics (MACLISP yielded numerical code as good as FORTRAN), and
widely used programs like editors (EMACS) and CAD (AUTOCAD).
There are introductions to the language:

  Sheila Hughes: Lisp. Pitman Publishing Limited, London 1986.
  Paul Graham: "ANSI Common Lisp", Prentice Hall, 1995, ISBN 0133708756.
  <http://paulgraham.com/acl.html>
  and "On Lisp", Prentice Hall, 1993. ISBN 0130305529.
  <http://paulgraham.com/onlisp.html>

After a while wou will need the standard text containing the language
definition:

  1st edition, 1984, 465 pages.
  2nd edition, 1990, 1032 pages.

LISP is run in an interactive environment. You input forms, and they will be
evaluated at once. Thus you can inspect variables, call functions with given
arguments or define your own functions.

#ifdef OS2

Hardware requirements:
----------------------

This OS/2 version of CLISP requires an 80386 (SX or DX) or an 80486 CPU,
running OS/2 2.0.
It also runs on a Pentium; the results CLISP produces are not affected by
the Intel Pentium's division bug.

#endif
#ifdef AMIGAOS

Hardware requirements:
----------------------

This Amiga version of CLISP requires at least 1.5MB RAM. The version called
CLISP-LOW runs on machines with no memory outside the 24 bit addressable
range: on 68000, A2620, A2630. The version called CLISP-HIGH runs in memory
that is 27 bit addressable (address range #x00000000 to #x07FFFFFF), but
only on 68020/030/040(/60?) CPU: on A3000 and A4000 without Zorro-III memory
boards. The version called CLISP-00 runs on 68000/010 CPU only but is faster
than CLISP-LOW. The version called CLISP-WIDE uses 64 bit integers and runs
in any memory on 68020 or better CPU: on A4000 using VMM. The overhead for
64 bit integers cause CLISP-WIDE to be slower than CLISP-HIGH.

#endif
#ifdef RISCOS

Hardware requirements:
----------------------

This version of CLISP requires an Acorn Archimedes or Acorn RISC PC with at
least 4MB RAM and RISC OS 3.0 or higher. See below how to produce a version
of CLISP that runs in only 2 MB.

#endif
#if defined(SINGLEMAP_MEMORY) && (defined(UNIX_LINUX) || !defined(HAVE_MMAP_ANON))

Software requirements:
----------------------

#ifdef UNIX_LINUX
#ifdef GENERATIONAL_GC
#ifdef IMMUTABLE
This version of CLISP requires Linux 1.2.2 or newer.
#else
This version of CLISP requires Linux 1.1.52 or newer.
#endif
#else
This version of CLISP requires Linux 0.99.7 or newer.
#endif
#endif
#if !defined(HAVE_MACH_VM) && !defined(HAVE_MMAP_ANON) /* impliziert HAVE_MMAP_DEVZERO */
/dev/zero must be readable by everyone. You may execute a "chmod a+r /dev/zero"
to ensure this.
#endif

#endif
#ifdef AMIGAOS

Software requirements:
----------------------

This version of CLISP requires OS 2.04 (V37) or newer.

#endif

Installation:
-------------

#ifdef OS2
First of all, install emx.dll and emxlibc.dll in a separate directory,
say c:\emx\dll. Add c:\emx\dll (insert the correct drive letter)
to the LIBPATH statement in your config.sys file. Reboot your computer
to enable the new LIBPATH statement and the new environment variables.

#endif
#ifdef EMUNIX
For overly long input lines to be displayed in a smart manner, it is necessary
that you have a line like

    DEVICE=ANSI.SYS

in your CONFIG.SYS file. Furthermore the environment variable TERM must
be set, and the environment variable TERMCAP must contain the slashified
file name of the terminal capabilities database termcap.dat. It is a good
idea to put this stuff into the clisp.bat built below. You may want to
install termcap.dat in a separate directory, say c:\emx\etc.

#endif
#if defined(UNIX) || defined(WIN32)
#if defined(UNIX) && !defined(UNIX_BINARY_DISTRIB)
Type

         make

#endif
Change the strings in src/config.lisp, using a text editor.
#else
Edit the contents of config.lisp appropriately for your site,
especially the definitions of short-site-name and long-site-name.
You may also want to edit the time zone definition at the end of
timezone.lisp.
#endif
Then start

#if defined(OS2) || defined(WIN32_NATIVE)
         lisp.exe -M lispinit.mem
#endif
#ifdef AMIGAOS
         lisp.run -M lispinit.mem
#endif
#ifdef UNIX
         base/lisp.run -M base/lispinit.mem
#endif
#ifdef RISCOS
         lisp -M mem.lispinit

or double click on the !Clisp directory.
#endif

When the LISP prompt

      > _

appears, type

#ifdef RISCOS
        (cd "<clisp$path>.")

to make sure the !Clisp directory is the currently selected directory. Then

#endif
#if defined(UNIX) || defined(WIN32)
      (without-package-lock ()
        (compile-file "src/config.lisp")
        (load "src/config.fas"))
#else
      (without-package-lock ()
        (compile-file "config.lisp")
        (load "config.fas"))

and - in case you modified timezone.lisp -

      (without-package-lock ()
        (compile-file "timezone.lisp")
        (load "timezone.fas"))
#endif

and then

#ifdef UNIX
        (cd "base/")
#endif
        (saveinitmem)

to overwrite the file lispinit.mem with your configuration. Then

        (exit)

#ifdef UNIX
The rest is done by a simple

        make install

Instead, you may do this yourself, step by step:

#endif
#ifndef RISCOS
If you want a minimal install, then create a directory, and put the
executable and the memory image there.
#endif
#ifdef UNIX
I would suggest /usr/local/lib/lisp :

   mkdir /usr/local/lib/lisp
   mv base/lisp.run /usr/local/lib/lisp
   mv base/lispinit.mem /usr/local/lib/lisp
#endif
#if defined(OS2) || defined(WIN32_NATIVE)
Assuming D:\LIB\LISP :

   mkdir d:\lib\lisp
   copy lisp.exe d:\lib\lisp
   copy lispinit.mem d:\lib\lisp
#endif

#if defined(OS2) || defined(WIN32_NATIVE)
And create a batch file that starts lisp:

#ifndef OS2
   copy con c:\bat\clisp.bat
#else
   copy con c:\cmd\clisp.cmd
#endif
#ifdef EMUNIX
   set TERM=ansi
   set TERMCAP=c:/emx/etc/termcap.dat
#endif
   d:\lib\lisp\lisp.exe -M d:\lib\lisp\lispinit.mem -B d:\lib\lisp\ %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
   [Ctrl-Z]
#endif

#ifdef WIN32_NATIVE
You can also use file install.bat which creates the driver file
on your desktop and sets up the registry.
#endif

#ifdef UNIX
And create the driver program that starts lisp:

#ifdef UNIX_BINARY_DISTRIB
   cc -O -DLISPLIBDIR='"/usr/local/lib/lisp"' \
         -DLOCALEDIR='"/usr/local/share/locale"' \
      src/clisp.c -o /usr/local/bin/clisp
#else
   ./hardcode -DLISPLIBDIR='/usr/local/lib/lisp' \
              -DLOCALEDIR='/usr/local/share/locale' \
              clisp /usr/local/bin/clisp
#endif

Now install the man page

   mv doc/clisp.1 /usr/local/man/man1/clisp.1

and try

   man clisp
#endif

#ifdef AMIGAOS

Note:
-----

You can start CLISP from Workbench(tm). The following Tooltypes are
recognized in the Tool Icon:

   WINDOW=<window or pipe specification>
   ARGS=<CLI-like arguments>

For example,

   WINDOW=CON:0/11/640/200/CLISP-Listener/CLOSE
   ARGS=-M lispinit.mem

#endif
#ifdef RISCOS

Short on memory?
----------------

If you have only 2 MB RAM, you can easily produce a stripped-down CLISP
that will require less memory, but lacks some parts of CLtL2, dpANS-LOOP,
CLOS, Conditions and generic streams: Replace defs2.fas, loop.fas, clos.fas,
conditio.fas, defs3.fas, gstream.fas by empty files and run

   lisp
   > (load "init.fas")
   > (saveinitmem)
   > (exit)

This will overwrite lispinit.mem with a smaller one.

#endif

When you encounter problems:
----------------------------

#ifdef EMUNIX
If clisp does not start up at all, check EMX-USER.DOC. lisp.exe is an EMX
application, so everything mentioned there applies to lisp.exe.

#endif
After errors, you are in the debugger:

     1. Break> _

You can evaluate forms, as usual. Furthermore:

     Help
               prints help
     Abort     or
     Unwind
               climbs up to the next higher input loop
     Backtrace
               shows the contents of the stack, helpful for debugging

And you can look at the values of the variables of the functions where the
error occurred.

#ifdef UNIX
On bigger problems, e.g. core dumps, please send a description of the error
#endif
#ifdef AMIGAOS
On bigger problems, e.g. "guru"s, please send a description of the error
#endif
#ifdef OS2
On bigger problems, e.g. register dumps, please send a description of the error
#endif
#ifdef RISCOS
On bigger problems, e.g. stack dumps, please send a description of the error
#endif
and how to produce it reliably to the authors or the maintainer.
Please accompany it with the CLISP version, which you get by calling
(lisp-implementation-version), as well as the OS name and version.
