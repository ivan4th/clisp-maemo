        * rlconf.h (PAREN_MATCHING): Define.
        * parens.c (rl_insert_close): Define the timeout to 1 sec, not 0.5 sec.

        * readline.h, readline.c (rl_already_prompted): New variable.
          Some applications have output the prompt themselves. readline
          needs to know about the prompt (for cursor movement) but must
          not output the prompt in the first run.
        * readline.h, display.c (rl_on_new_line_with_prompt): New function.
        * readline.c (readline_internal_setup): Call it.
        * display.c (rl_redisplay): Don't access prompt_this_line[-2],
          the prompt may be shorter than this.

        * readline.c (rl_present_p): Add constant flag. A replacement
          library libnoreadline.a shall define rl_present_p = 0. An
          application can then determine at run time whether is was linked
          with libreadline.a or libnoreadline.a.
        * readline.c (RL_LIBRARY_VERSION): Set to "2.2-clisp".

        Added ANSI C prototypes, such that the library can be compiled
        using "gcc -Wall -Wmissing-prototypes".
        * ansi_proto.h, xmalloc.h, shell.h: New files.
        * Makefile.in: Update.
        * tilde.h, tilde.c: Add prototypes.
        * history.h: Add prototypes.
        * histlib.h: Add extern declarations.
        * histexpand.c, histfile.c, history.c, histsearch.c: Remove extern
          declarations.
        * readline.h: Add extern declarations and prototypes.
        * bind.c, callback.c, complete.c, display.c, funmap.c, input.c,
          isearch.c, keymaps.c, kill.c, macro.c, nls.c, parens.c, readline.c,
          rltty.c, search.c, signals.c, terminal.c, util.c, vi_mode.c: Remove
          extern declarations.
