URGENT PROBLEMS
===============

Should handle these soon.


IMMUTABLE & WIDE_SOFT: With or without MORRIS_GC, the immutable bit of
objects gets lost during GC.


clisp-link: don't copy modules.o, instead compile it freshly.


MAYBE
=====

Still have to think about these, whether they are good ideas or not.


CR/LF -> NL conversion in pipe streams and socket streams (Unix and Win32)?


Emacs interface: How to customize (or fix?) ILISP?


Install .dvi man page as well, not only .[13] and .html man page.


Having two different handlings of Ctrl-C (once as a serious-condition, once
directly through tast_break(), bypassing ERROR and SIGNAL) is horrible.
Introduce a class of SERIOUS-CONDITION and then remove BATCHMODE-BREAK-DRIVER.


On HP-UX (9|10), with (readline|newreadline), there has been the problem
that Ctrl-C at the line prompt works once, but not a second time. This
appears fixed on HP-UX 9 with readline.


upgrade to newest CLN, but still big-endian and without gmp


Distribute impnotes.txt as a patch against Harlequin's HyperSpec.
(We cannot distribute the patched HyperSpec because the copyright
forbids this.)


Add Unicode (ISO 10646-1) support. Extend the CHARACTER type to have 24 bits
instead of 16: 4 "bits", 4 "font", 16 "unicode". A Latin-1 character will
consist of the following 32 bits:  |typecode|bits|font|00000000|Latin-1code|
Problem: Streams of type CHARACTER - shall they transmit their characters in
24 bit chunks or in UTF-8 format?


If you (TRACE generic-function) and then reload the file defining that
function, you get an error saying that #<CLOSURE TRACED-xxx> is not a generic
function.


FFI: Introduce a macro like CMU's FFI:ADDR


FFI: Actually support :language :cc/:gcc by passing appropriate flags
to the avcall/vacall macros. The default should be the same compiler
as the one used to compile clisp.


(read-char *keyboard-input*) is still not perfect. Under Linux, it
returns the following key sequences for some keystrokes:

Under xterm:
Shift F1 --> F11
Shift F2 --> F12
Shift F3 --> Escape [ 2 5 ~
Shift F4 --> Escape [ 2 6 ~
Shift F5 --> Escape [ 2 8 ~
Shift F6 --> Escape [ 2 9 ~
Shift F7 --> Escape [ 3 1 ~
Shift F8 --> Escape [ 3 2 ~
Shift F9 --> F9
Shift F10 --> F10
Shift F11 --> F11
Shift F12 --> F12
Home -> Escape [ 7
End -> Escape [ 8

Under console:
Home -> Escape [ 1
End -> Escape [ 4
F6, F7, F8 -> Escape [ 1
F9 -> Escape [ 2 0
F10 -> Escape [ 2 1
F11, Sh-F11 -> Escape [ 2 3
F12, Sh-F12 -> Escape [ 2 4
Shift F1 --> Escape [ 2 3
Shift F2 --> Escape [ 2 4
Shift F3 --> Escape [ 2 5
Shift F4 --> Escape [ 2 6
Shift F5 --> Escape [ 2 8
Shift F6 --> Escape [ 2 9
Shift F7 --> Escape [ 3 1
Shift F8 --> Escape [ 3 2
Shift F9 --> Escape [ 3 3
Shift F10 --> Escape [ 3 4
Ctrl-Alt-Q --> nothing at all
NumLock doesn't work


Browse in dpANS to see which situations require the following conditions:
    # all kinds of conditions
    condition,
      # conditions that require interactive intervention
      serious_condition,
        # serious conditions that occur deterministically
        error,
          # when some datum does not belong to the expected type
          type_error,
          # errors while doing stream I/O
          stream_error,
          # errors with pathnames, OS level errors with streams
          file_error,
        # "Virtual memory exhausted"
        storage_condition,
      # conditions for which user notification is appropriate
      warning,
CLISP always issues a condition type that makes sense, but in some case
dpANS may force us it to switch to a more specific condition type.


Looks at GCL CLCS (debugger.lsp top-patches.lsp condition-definitions.lsp)
whether it contains something clisp could profit from.


Debugger (user1.lsp, debug.d): Implement backtrace-? commands with a limit,
such that  BACKTRACE-1 20  will show the 20 newest frames. Good for people
without a "cmdtool" or an xterm with logging.

The general rule:
If it hurts CLtL1 programs, don't do it. Or put a CLtL1 symbol into
the LISP package and a CLtL2 symbol into the COMMON-LISP package. (There's
precedent for it: FLET, LABELS, IN-PACKAGE.)
If it doesn't hurt CLtL1 programs:
  If it makes sense and people want it, do it.
  If it is a bad idea, explain to people.
  If it is a good idea and people want it, maybe do it.
  If noone bothers, why?


The completion in user2.lsp does bad things with respect to upper case and
lower case of symbols. Assume the symbols |TMP|, |TMP structure class|
are interned. Then type a tab in the following situations:
> (symbol-plist '\tmp
> 'tm
> '|
> '"tm


user1.lsp: provide a hook to extend commands1.
Rick Taube does the following in his Common Music package:
    (setf (symbol-function '.oldcommands1.)
       (symbol-function 'sys::commands1))
    (setf (symbol-function 'sys::commands1)
       #'(lambda ()
           (append (funcall (symbol-function '.oldcommands1.))
                   (list (cons "TL" #'tl)))))))
"The ugliest hack I have ever written", he writes. And he is probably right.


NOT TO DO
=========

These have been in my mind, but are probably bad ideas.


Declaration  extern maygc ...

You can't put this declaration into a C macro definition. Therefore the
right place for it is still the comment.


Amiga: handling of Ctrl-C in stream.d

I think we have fixed this finally.


Block the signals SIGHUP SIGPIPE SIGTERM SIGXCPU SIGXFSZ during GC, and
when they occur outside of GC, do a quit(1); .

Programs that deal too much with signals tend to be unfriendly. I hate
programs which stay alive when I try to kill them.


The APPLY package wants a variable *print-right-margin*.

What for? XP is broken, and I don't want to support it. Not even a single
variable of it.


arivaxvms.d: WCL's BigNum/vaxKerN.s says that under VMS only r0-r1, not
r0-r5, can be freely used. Therefore save r2-r5 by modifying the .word
statement at the entry point.

The VMS port has been stopped. Noone is interested in it.


Punimax has been reported to dump core on Linux by 2 people.

I haven't been able to reproduce it.


New memory management model for Sun3: a mixture between SPVW_MIXED_BLOCKS
and SPVW_PURE_BLOCKS, a mixture between SINGLEMAP_MEMORY and MULTIMAP_MEMORY.

What's the point? Who is using Sun3's any more?


The ONCE-ONLY macro from Norvig's book code does not work in clisp.
The backquote macro is the problem.

I think Norvig's code is broken because it will only work in Steele's
backquote implementation (CLtL2 appendix).
