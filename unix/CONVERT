Explanation of the optional installation step 1:
------------------------------------------------

If your local character set is not ISO Latin-1 or if your C compiler is not
8-bit clean, you will have to convert the sources.

First compile the program for conversion to plain ASCII and install it
somewhere in your path:

    cd ../utils/charset
    make unix bindir=/usr/local/bin
    cd ../..

If you are using csh, the following is necessary:

    rehash

Convert the sources:

    all-to-ascii [A-Z]* src/* utils/* doc/*

Done.

If your local character set is the NeXTstep character set, use the
corresponding program for conversion to this character set similarly:

    cd ../utils/charset
    make next bindir=/usr/local/bin
    cd ../..
    rehash # only if using csh
    all-to-next [A-Z]* src/* utils/* doc/* nextapp/*/*.[mh]
