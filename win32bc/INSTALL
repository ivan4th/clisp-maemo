Installation on Win32 (WinNT, Win95) using the Borland C++ 5.0 development
==========================================================================
environment, using native system calls
======================================

** WARNING **:
The preferred Win32 for CLISP is MSVC. CLISP built with Borland C++ exhibits
the following problems:
* Generational GC and lazy image file loading don't work.
* The function ISQRT is miscompiled.
* Stack overflow handling doesn't work.
* No foreign function interface.

1. On a Unix NFS server, unpack the source.

2. In Borland's include\stdarg.h correct line 20:
        #error Can't ...
   to
        #error "Can't ..."

3. Get a decent "make" utility, for example "amake.exe" from
   ftp://ftp.absoft.com/pub/windows/profortran/amake.zip .
   (Borland's "make" complains about "Command line too long".
   Microsoft's "nmake" would work as well, except for a problem with "%"
   characters in the command line.)

4. On a Win32 NFS client, start a console with a shell (ksh for example).
   Make sure that the BC++5.0 utilities ("bcc32i" etc.) are found in PATH.

        cd utils
        cd gcc-cccp
        amake -f Makefile.bc
        cd ..
        cd ..
        cp win32bc/makefile src/makefile

   Modify the values of BCDIR and WIN32DIR in src/makefile to match your site.
   Then

        cd src
        amake

   If this fails just after saving "interpreted.mem", just remove
   "interpreted.mem" and retry

        amake

5. On the Unix NFS server:

        cd src
        make distrib
