       Frequently asked questions about the DOS version of CLISP
       ---------------------------------------------------------

Q1: Can someone tell me what the following error message means
    "Virtual mode not supported without VCPI"

A1: (Eberhard Mattes, see EMX-USER.DOC)
    A VCPI server is required to run emx if the CPU is in virtual mode.
    You'll get this message if you're using an EMS driver (EMS emulator)
    which doesn't support VCPI or if you've disabled EMS. Remedy: Remove
    the EMS driver, use an EMS driver which supports VCPI or enable EMS
    if it has been disabled (for instance, remove the NOEMS keyword from
    the command line of the EMS driver).

A2: (Kris Karas <ktk@enterprise.bih.harvard.edu>)
    I bet your CONFIG.SYS looks like this:
        DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS
        DEVICE=EMM386.EXE NOEMS
    It's the darned NOEMS keyword that's preventing EMM386 from giving
    CLISP expanded memory emulation.  When I changed NOEMS to RAM (so that
    I could still load programs into the High Memory Area) CLISP became
    happy - somewhat.  CLISP was running very, very slowly.  I went to
    compile CONFIG.LSP and it took nearly 15 minutes on a 486/33 with 20MB
    of RAM memory!!!  Turns out the problem was that if CLISP finds any
    expanded memory, it uses it; if not, is looks for extended memory.
    When I removed the EMM386 driver from CONFIG.SYS altogether, CLISP
    sped up by a factor of 20 or more!  You'll need to play around with
    the memory management settings to see just which amounts of which type
    of memory will make CLISP happiest on your machine.

Q3: CLISP runs, but incredibly slowly: it needs 90 seconds to start up.

A3: See answer A2 above.
