Installation on DOS using DJGPP:
--------------------------------

** WARNING **:
The preferred DOS extender for CLISP is EMX. According to Ryu Young,
<ryoung@utdallas.edu>, CLISP built with DJGPP exhibits the following problems:
* Ctrl-C aborts the program ungracefully.
* Running CLISP under Desqview/X results in a segment violation error and
  halts the system.
Additionally, I have observed the following problem:
* If a program built with DJGPP is running at midnight, the DOS clock wraps
  back by 24 hours (time switches back to 00:00 but the date doesn't advance).

1. Get and install DJGPP.
   DJGPP is D.J. Delorie's 32-bit extender. You can get it by anonymous ftp
   from omnigate.clarkson.edu. You will need DJGPP 1.12 or newer.

   Install the real-mode C:\DJGPP\UTILS\GCC-RM\GCC.EXE as C:\DJGPP\BIN\GCC.EXE.
   The 32-bit mode (default) gcc.exe has proved unusable for me.

2. Make sure that \DJGPP\BIN is in your path, before any directory that
   contains programs named CPP.EXE or AS.EXE. Set the environment variables
   COMPILER_PATH, C_INCLUDE_PATH, LIBRARY_PATH and TEMP, GO32TMP, GO32, 387.
   For example:

         PATH=C:\DJGPP\BIN;%PATH%
         set COMPILER_PATH=c:/djgpp/bin
         set C_INCLUDE_PATH=c:/djgpp/include
         set LIBRARY_PATH=c:/djgpp/lib
         set TEMP=c:/temp
         set GO32TMP=c:/temp
         set GO32=ansi driver c:\djgpp\drivers\tseng4k.grd gw 1024 gh 768 tw 132 th 43 nc 256
         set 387=YES

   This must be done before executing ANY executable produced by DJGPP.

3. Choose a directory for Clisp, say \CLISP.

         CD \CLISP

   Unpack the sources in this directory:

         PKUNZIP -d CLISP.ZIP
   or
         TAR xvf CLISP.TAR

4. Convert the sources to the IBM PC character set.
   They are distributed in ISO Latin-1 character set.

         cd dos
         gcc -O cv_lt_pc.c -o cv_lt_pc
         copy /b c:\djgpp\bin\go32.exe + cv_lt_pc cv_lt_pc.exe
         del cv_lt_pc
         cv_lt_pc < convert.bax > convert.bat
         convert.bat
         cd ..

   Edit DOSDJGPP\MAKEFILE and adjust the path c:\djgpp\bin\ therein
   to fit your setup.

   Copy some DOSDJGPP specific files into SRC:

         DOSDJGPP\COPYX.BAT

   You may then delete unnecessary files:

         DOS\DELX.BAT

5.-9. Proceed as described in dos/INSTALL 5.-9.
