Installation on Win32 (WinNT, Win95) using the mingw32 development environment
==============================================================================
using gcc and native Win32 system calls
=======================================

This is experimental! I wasn't able to build CLISP with mingw32 on WinNT 3.51.
setjmp()/longjmp() crash the program, no workaround known. This kind of bug
is probably the consequence of the mingw32's architecture.

1. Get Mingw32 from ftp://ftp.deninc.com/pub/egcs/mingw32/releases/.
   Install it, set the environment variables mentioned in mingw32.bat.

2. (Optional.)
   Get Cygwin32 CDK from ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/latest/.
   Install only bash.exe and cygwin32.dll in mingw32's bin\ directory.
   Also create a directory \tmp\.
