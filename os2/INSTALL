Installation on OS/2:
---------------------

1. Get and install EMX.
   EMX is Eberhard Mattes' Unix emulation for DOS and OS/2. You can get it
   by anonymous ftp from ftp.uni-stuttgart.de or ftp-os2.cdrom.com.
   You will need EMX 0.9c or newer.

2. Make sure that \EMX\BIN is in your path, before any directory that
   contains programs named CPP.EXE or AS.EXE. Set the environment variables
   C_INCLUDE_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH. For example:

         PATH=C:\EMX\BIN;%PATH%
         SET C_INCLUDE_PATH=c:/emx/include
         SET LIBRARY_PATH=c:/emx/lib

   This must be done before executing ANY executable produced by EMX
   except LISP.EXE which will be created in a special way.

   Also install a `working' MAKE.EXE, e.g. dmake or GNU make. If you have
   problems with "make", try "make -n > h.bat" and then executing "h".

   Further you need `working' versions of SH.EXE, CP.EXE, RM.EXE, and GREP.EXE.

3. Choose a directory for Clisp, say \CLISP.

         CD \CLISP

   Unpack the sources in this directory:

         PKUNZIP -d CLISP.ZIP
   or
         TAR xvf CLISP.TAR

4. Convert the sources to the IBM PC character set.
   They are distributed in ISO Latin-1 character set.

         cd os2
         copy ..\dos\cv_lt_pc.c
         gcc -O cv_lt_pc.c -o cv_lt_pc.exe
         cv_lt_pc < convert.bax > convert.cmd
         convert.cmd
         cd ..

   Copy some OS/2 specific files into SRC:

         OS2\COPYX.CMD

5. Go to directory

         cd src

6. Build the readline library:

         cd readline
         make
         cd ..

7. Type

         make config.lsp

   and edit the contents of config.lsp appropriately for your site,
   especially the definitions of short-site-name and long-site-name.

8. Type

         make

   to build CLISP.
   You may alternatively do this in six steps:
         make init                prepares all symbolic links and utilities
         make allc                makes all *.c files
         make lisp.exe            makes the executable
         make interpreted.mem     a memory image with everything uncompiled
         make lispinit.mem        makes all *.fas files and
                                  a memory image with everything compiled
         make manual              makes the documentation
   The fifth step is the most time consuming: it takes about an hour on a
   486/33 and may take several hours on a slower machine.

9. Make a directory for a lasting installation of CLISP, say D:\LIB\LISP.
   Copy lisp.exe and lispinit.mem there:

         copy lisp.exe D:\LIB\LISP\lisp.exe
         copy lispinit.mem D:\LIB\LISP\lispinit.mem

   Make a batch file for CLISP in a directory belonging to your PATH:

         copy con D:\CMD\CLISP.CMD
         D:\LIB\LISP\lisp.exe -M D:\LIB\LISP\lispinit.mem %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
         [Ctrl-Z]

   Don't forget the documentation:

         copy ..\OS2\CLISP.* D:\LIB\LISP
         copy ..\OS2\IMPNOTES.HTML D:\LIB\LISP

   You can now remove directory \CLISP and all its contents.


Cross-Compilation for OS/2, assuming you are running DOS:
---------------------------------------------------------

Copy os2/makefile to dos/makefile and proceed as described in dos/INSTALL.
