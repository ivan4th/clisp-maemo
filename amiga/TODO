o Handle symbolic links better.
  Probably involves NewLock() function doing a lot of work.

o Use SystemTagList() instead of Execute() to be able to return the exit
  code from EXECUTE and SHELL, like the UNIX version. Take care that (SHELL)
  still works, and that it doesn't close the handle twice or not at all,
  preventing the console window from closing.

o When GNUEmacs kills a process, FIFO: returns an error to Write(), causing
  CLISP to go into an endless error ... reset loop attempting to print an
  error message to Output().

o Localize using locale.library. How to build the numeric IDs for both C and
  Lisp files?

o Accept "AUX:" and "NIL:" as filenames to (at least) OPEN. Probably
  difficult, as this syntax in CLISP means that there's no filename.
  Accepting "*" (CONSOLE:) is probably even more difficult, as it is
  interpreted as a wildcard.

o? Use NameFromLock() where appropriate. CLISP still uses the 1.3-compatible
  ParentDir() method.

o? Implement (in Lisp) MAKE-PIPE-INPUT/OUTPUT/IO-STREAM, RUN-SHELL-COMMAND
  and RUN-PROGRAM using FIFO:

o? Implement (in Lisp only) socket functions using AmiTCP's TCP:

o Implement some WAIT and SIGNAL-HANDLER functionality. WAIT would wait for
  some signals and handle others that arrive in between. Signal handlers
  might be called by tast_break() and REXX.D:rexx_wait()
