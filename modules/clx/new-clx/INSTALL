Installation instructions for NEW-CLX
-------------------------------------

To install the NEW-CLX module, do the following:

$ ./configure --with-module=clx/new-clx --cbc build-X

If your X libraries and includes are in a weird place,
pass --x-includes=... and/or --x-libraries=... to configure above.

If you have built clisp already,

$ cd build-dir && make MODULES=clx/new-clx MODULE_CONFIGURE_FLAGS='--x-includes=... --x-libraries=...'

If the configure script detects xshape and xpm extensions, it enables them.
To avoid that, edit clx/new-clx/Makefile in your build directory
and replace -DWANT_XPM=1 and/or -DWANT_XSHAPE=1 with "...=0",
and then run "make full" again.
