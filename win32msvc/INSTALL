Installation on Win32 (WinNT, Win95) using the MSVC4.0 or MSVC5.0 or MSVC6.0
============================================================================
development environment, using native system calls
==================================================

1. Build a few recommended libraries: libiconv and libsigsegv.
   - GNU libsigsegv (highly recommended for C stack overflow detection),
   - GNU libiconv (for more character set conversions).

2. Unpack the source, start a console with a shell.
   Make sure that the MSVC4.0 or MSVC5.0 or MSVC6.0 utilities ("cl" etc.)
   are found in PATH. For example, I use the following settings:

        set MSDEVDIR=C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio
        set MSVCDIR=%MSDEVDIR%\VC98
        set Include=%MSDEVDIR%\VC98\include
        set Lib=%MSDEVDIR%\VC98\lib
        set PATH=%MSDEVDIR%\VC98\bin;%MSDEVDIR%\Common\MSDev98\Bin;%PATH%

   Alternatively you can use a file vcvars32.bat supplied with MSVC. Copy
   it to some location in the PATH and add the following line to its end:

        %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

   Now you can call VC command line utilities in the proper enviroinment
   prepending it with vcvars32. For example
       
        vcvars32 nmake

3. Ensure unix-like command-line utilities used in the build: sed, grep,
   touch, rm (more the better) are in the PATH. There are a few such packages
   available, for example UnxUtils (http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/) or
   cygwin (overkill for this particular case).


   Then build a few tools and libraries:

        cd utils
        cd gcc-cccp
        nmake -f Makefile.msvc
        cd ..
        cd ..

        cd ffcall
        nmake -f Makefile.msvc check
        cd ..

        cd libcharset
        nmake -f Makefile.msvc check
        cd ..

   Copy the appropriate makefile to src\makefile:

     for MSVC4.0:

        copy win32msvc\makefile.msvc4 src\makefile

     for MSVC5.0 or MSVC6.0:

        copy win32msvc\makefile.msvc5 src\makefile

     same, debug version:

        copy win32msvc\makefile.msvc5d src\makefile

   Check that enviroinment variable MSVCDIR points to VC98 directory
   or uncomment and modify the value of MSVCDIR in src\makefile to
   match your site.

        cd src
        nmake

4. (optional) Using cygwin:

        cd src
        make distrib
