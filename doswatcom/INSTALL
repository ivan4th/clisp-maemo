Installation on DOS using WATCOM C 9.5:
---------------------------------------

** WARNING **:
The preferred DOS extender for CLISP is EMX. CLISP built with WATCOM C will
exhibits the following problems:
* The readline editing capabilities are not built in.
* Ctrl-C aborts the program ungracefully.
* It is slower.

1. Get and install the WATCOM C/C++^32 9.5 compiler. It is commercial
   software; you cannot get it by anonymous ftp.
   Only the C, 386, non-Windows part of the development system will be needed.
   The C++, 8086, 286, Windows parts of the development system can be removed.

2. Make sure WATCOM's \BIN are \BINB directories are in your path. Set the
   environment variables WATCOM and INCLUDE. For example:

         PATH=C:\WATCOM95\BIN;C:\WATCOM95\BINB;C:\WATCOM95\BINW;%PATH%
         set WATCOM=C:\WATCOM95
         set INCLUDE=C:\WATCOM95\H
         set DOS4G=QUIET

3. Choose a directory for Clisp, say \CLISP.

         CD \CLISP

   Unpack the sources in this directory:

         PKUNZIP -d CLISP.ZIP
   or
         TAR xvf CLISP.TAR

4. Convert the sources to the IBM PC character set.
   They are distributed in ISO Latin-1 character set.

         cd dos
         wcl386 -ox cv_lt_pc.c
         cv_lt_pc < convert.bax > convert.bat
         convert.bat
         cd ..

   Copy some DOS or WATCOM specific files into SRC:

         DOSWATCOM\COPYX.BAT

   You may then delete unnecessary files:

         DOS\DELX.BAT

5.-10. Proceed as described in dos/INSTALL 5. and 7.-10.
