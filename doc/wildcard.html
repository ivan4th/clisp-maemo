<P>
Wildcards, also called "Shell Filename Patterns", describe sets of file names.

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>wildcard</CODE> package exports the following symbol:

</P>
<P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> <B>match</B> <I>pattern string [:start] [:end] [:case-insensitive]</I>
<DD><A NAME="IDX1"></A>
This function returns a non-<CODE>nil</CODE> value if the <VAR>string</VAR> matches
the <VAR>pattern</VAR>.

</P>
</DL>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>*</CODE>
<DD>
Matches any zero or more characters.

<DT><CODE>?</CODE>
<DD>
Matches any one character.

<DT><CODE>[<VAR>string</VAR>]</CODE>
<DD>
Matches exactly one character that is a member of the string
<VAR>string</VAR>.  This is called a <EM>character class</EM>.  As a shorthand,
<VAR>string</VAR> may contain ranges, which consist of two characters with a
dash between them.  For example, the class <SAMP>`[a-z0-9_]'</SAMP> matches a
lowercase letter, a number, or an underscore.  You can negate a class by
placing a <SAMP>`!'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`^'</SAMP> immediately after the opening bracket.
Thus, <SAMP>`[^A-Z@]'</SAMP> matches any character except an uppercase letter
or an at sign.

<DT><CODE>\</CODE>
<DD>
Removes the special meaning of the character that follows it.  This
works even in character classes.
</DL>

<P>
Slash characters have no special significance in the wildcard matching,
unlike in the shell, in
which wildcards do not match them.  Therefore, a pattern <SAMP>`foo*bar'</SAMP>
can match a file name <SAMP>`foo3/bar'</SAMP>, and a pattern <SAMP>`./sr*sc'</SAMP> can
match a file name <SAMP>`./src/misc'</SAMP>.
