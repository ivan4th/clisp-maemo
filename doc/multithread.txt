                              Multithreading
                              ==============

is currently being developed and does not work yet.

Installation
------------

In the Makefile, define in the CFLAGS the symbol MULTITHREAD and one of
the symbols POSIX_THREADS, POSIXOLD_THREADS, SOLARIS_THREADS, C_THREADS,
WIN32_THREADS. (See xthread.d about their meaning.)

Symbol values
-------------

Any symbol can be in one of five states:

  - Global Variable. This means that SYMBOL-VALUE of the symbol accesses
    the same value cell for all threads.

  - Global Constant. This is the same as Global Variable, except that the
    value cell cannot be modified. And the compiler can optimize this kind
    of symbols.

  - Per-Thread Variable. This means that every thread has its private value
    cell which is accessed by SYMBOL-VALUE. LET/LET*/MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND
    bindings of the variable will affect the lexical environment only, not
    the value cell, unless the variable is locally declared SPECIAL.

  - Per-Thread Special Variable. This means that every thread has its private
    value cell which is accessed by SYMBOL-VALUE. LET/LET*/MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND
    bindings of the variable will affect this value cell.

  - Lazy. This is the initial state of the symbol. It lasts until
      - a DEFGLOBAL or DEFCONSTANT declaration for the symbol is evaluated,
        in which case the symbol becomes a Global Variable or a Global Constant,
    or
      - a SPECIAL proclamation for the symbol is evaluated,
        in which case the symbol becomes a Per-Thread Special Variable,
    or
      - a SYMBOL-VALUE reference for the symbol is evaluated,
        in which case the symbol becomes a Per-Thread Variable.

Once a symbol is Global or Per-Thread, this cannot change any more.
However, a Global Variable can become a Global Constant (by means of a
DEFCONSTANT declaration), and a Per-Thread Variable can become a
Per-Thread Special Variable (by means of a SPECIAL proclamation).

The Common Lisp standard variables are all Per-Thread, except *features* and
*modules*, which are Global.

Packages
--------

PACKAGE objects are LOCKABLE and are locked by INTERN before adding a
symbol (if FUND-SYMBOL fails).
This puts an unknown speed penalty on READ and therefore LOAD.

CLOS
----

DEFCLASS, DEFGENERIC, DEFMETHOD, DEFSTRUCT must get a global "DEF-CLOS"
lock because they change the global class hierarchy.

Hash Tables and Sequences
-------------------------

Nothing is ever locked, so the user is required to use locks when
sharing HASH-TABLEs and SEQUENCEs between threads.
If two threads evaluate
   (INCF (GETHASH x global-ht 0)),
the results are undefined.
Automatic locking will impose an unjustifiable penalty on HASH-TABLEs
and SEQUENCEs local to threads.
It is also consistent with the usual Common Lisp approach of
   http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/Body/sec_3-6.html:
        The consequences are undefined when code executed during an
        object-traversing operation destructively modifies the object in
        a way that might affect the ongoing traversal operation...

Garbage Collector
-----------------

GC must stop all other threads while it is executing.
CLISP has a copying GC, so anything else would require a write barrier
during the scan phase and a read barrier during the move phase.
