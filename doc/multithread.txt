                              ==============

is currently being developed but is usable.

Installation
------------

In the Makefile, define in the CFLAGS the symbol MULTITHREAD and one of
the symbols POSIX_THREADS, WIN32_THREADS.
(See xthread.d about their meaning.)
Alternatively, you can pass "--with-threads=flavor" to the top-level
configure ("flavor" is one of POSIX_THREADS, WIN32_THREADS).
