clisp (1:2.44.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

       + When *CURRENT-LANGUAGE* is incompatible with *TERMINAL-ENCODING*,
         CLISP no longer goes into an infinite recursion trying to print
         various help messages. [ 1865636 ]
       + Fix the "Quit" debugger command. [ 1448744 ]
       + Repeated terminating signals kill CLISP instantly with the correct
         exit code. [ 1871205 ]
       + Stack inspection is now safer. [ 1506316 ]
       + Errors in the RC-file and init files are now handled properly. 
          [ 1714737 ]
       + Avoid the growth of the restart set with each image save. [ 1877497 ]
       + Handle foreign functions coming from the old image which cannot be

    https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=101355&aid=1569234&group_id=1355

  * Disable FFI on mipsel, fixes the FTBFS.
  * Ignore the results of running the tests because the network
    stack is sometimes not correct on the buildd daemons (localhost
    does not resolve). We still do run the tests and we will review
    the output of the buildd daemons for 'real' problems.
    Fixes the FTBFS for amd64, hppa. (Closes: 388752)

  * Don't use -O0 anymore for ia64, hint from Dr. Werner Fink at suse.de
  * Run tests after building the clisp.
  * Drop support for sparc. Not having a machine to test sparc problems
    on just makes it too difficult to support. I hope not many users will
    be impacted. (Closes: #386075)

    Closes: #377722
  * New upstream. Highlights of this new version:

    - FFI:UINT64 and FFI:SINT64 are now compatible with C's long long type.
    - Stack overflow detection and recovery finally work fine on Unix.
    - It is now possible to specify the default method-combination of a generic
      function,
    - Readline completion works with non 1:1 terminal encodings, e.g. UTF-8.
    - WITH-KEYBOARD works with a Unix tty even when SLIME hijacks *TERMINAL-IO*.
    - New functions: POSIX:FFS, POSIX:PATHCONF.
    - Bug fixes:
      + SOCKET:SOCKET-SERVER :INTERFACE now behaves as documented.
      + EXT:READ-BYTE-NO-HANG and SOCKET:SOCKET-STATUS used to hang on
        buffered binary sockets.
      + Allow DESTRUCTURING-BIND (a . b) with circular and dotted lists.
      + ADJUST-ARRAY of zero length adjustable string now works.
      + TIME now reports correct results when the heap grows over 4GB.
      + RAWSOCK functions now handle :START/:END arguments correctly.
      + BDB:DBC-GET now accepts :READ-COMMITTED and :READ-UNCOMMITTED.
      + POSIX:GROUP-INFO and POSIX:USER-INFO now handle errors correctly.

clisp (1:2.38-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force ia64 to compile with -O0, this seems to fix the crashes
    when using gcc-4.1. Closes: #373697
  * For the same bug: we now undef unused before including signal.h
    because unused is used in the user_fpregs struct on arm.
    Should fix FTBFS on arm.
  * Make configure and other scripts executable on clean

  * Updated standards version without real changes.

    + Adding a small patch to debian/rules to substitue the dependency
      on gcc-3.3 on these architectures for clisp-dev (with a variable
      in debian/control).
    + Add -falign-functions=4 to CFLAGS to fix FTBFS on AMD64.
      See: https://launchpad.net/products/clisp/+bug/6511
    + Change Predepends of xlibs to libx11-6 libxext6 libxpm4

clisp (1:2.38-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream.
  * Maybe amd64 will work with gcc-3.3?
    Is a working debian host to test this on
    not nice? Sigh. We will see if it fails
    again. Seeing the logs would help.

    Thanks to Ubuntu to actually have the
    buildd logs available.
  * As it is impossible to have a dependency on gcc-3.3
    only for some architectures, have _all_ of them
    depend on gcc-3.3, but add build-essential
    for all other architectures.
  * Fixed Build-dep on libreadline-dev (Closes: #351339)

  * Simplified creation of mem files: now the
    original file is always left in place, and 
    a new file with clc in created on install.

 -- Peter Van Eynde <pvaneynd@debian.org>  Sat,  5 Nov 2005 23:38:58 +0100

clisp (1:2.35-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * So with gcc-4 on sparc we got the pretty impressive:
    ;; Loading file defs1.lisp ...
    *** - quotient GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG\
    0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG / GGGGGGGG\
     is not an integer

    Now on m68k we get the even more impressive:

    cat '/build/buildd/clisp-2.35/src/intparam.c' >> tmp.c
    gcc -D SAFETY=3 -D NO_MULTIMAP_SHM -D NO_MULTIMAP_FILE \
     -D NO_SINGLEMAP -D NO_TRIVIALMAP tmp.c -o intparam
    tmp.c: In function 'main5':
    tmp.c:422: internal compiler error: in instantiate_virtual_regs_lossage,
    at function.c:1442

    So we're going to use gcc-3.3 for both architectures and hope
    that upstream or the gcc maintainers get this one right.

    Change: also use gcc-3.3 for m68k.
