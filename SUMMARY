Common Lisp is a high-level, all-purpose programming language.
CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe
University and Michael Stoll of Munich University, both in Germany.
It mostly supports the Lisp described in "Common LISP: The Language
(2nd edition)" and the ANSI Common Lisp standard.
It runs on microcomputers (DOS, OS/2, Windows NT, Windows 95, Amiga
500-4000, Acorn RISC PC) as well as on Unix workstations (Linux, SVR4,
Sun4, DEC Alpha OSF, HP-UX, NeXTstep, SGI, AIX, Sun3 and others) and
needs only 2 MB of RAM.
It is free software and may be distributed under the terms of GNU GPL,
while it is possible to distribute commercial applications compiled
with CLISP.
The user interface comes in German, English, French and Spanish.
CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a large subset of CLOS, a
foreign language interface and a socket interface.
An X11 interface is available through CLX and Garnet.
