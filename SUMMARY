   CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe
   University and Michael Stoll of Munich University, both in Germany.
   It mostly supports the Lisp described in "Common LISP: The Language
   (2nd edition)" and the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  It runs on
   microcomputers (DOS, OS/2, Windows NT, Windows 95, Amiga 500-4000,
   Acorn RISC PC) as well as on Unix workstations (Linux, SVR4, Sun4,
   DEC Alpha OSF, HP-UX, NeXTstep, SGI, AIX, Sun3 and others) and needs
   only 2 MB of RAM.  It is free software and may be distributed under the
   terms of GNU GPL.  The user interface comes in German, English, French
   and Spanish. CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a large subset
   of CLOS, a foreign language interface and a socket interface.  An X11
   interface is available through CLX and Garnet.
   Available by anonymous ftp from ftp2.cons.org in the directory
